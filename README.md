# Facial-Recognition-with-Deep-Neural-Networks-and-Transfer-Learning

This is a facial recognition system recognising the faces of various individuals. During this project, the model was trained only on seven individual's faces. Hence, the system will only recognize the faces of seven individuals. This project attempts to recognise human faces with higher accuracy while having fewer data to train on with the use of transfer learning.

I would like to thank Ajay Maharjan, Ankit Dahal, Kabir Tamang, Prabesh Hada, Sasim Sunwar, Sundar Bhattrai and Suryansh Mathema. And I would like to send regards to Mr Saroj Lamichhane and Mr Bijay Limbu Senihang for being there as my project supervisors and supporting me along the way.

Go ahead and download the pre-trained model 'rcmalli_vggface_tf_vgg16.h5' from the site: https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface/releases and store it in the 'models' directory of this repository. 

Add your custom dataset in the 'dataset' directory of this repository. Do some minor adjustments according to your need and its ready to go.


Things to note:::

1. First, install the following dependencies:
    #pip3 install tensorFlow keras pandas numpy sklearn opencv-python imutils

2. Second, fire the terminal and go to the project directory. Once there, follow:
    #chmod +x script.py
    #python script.py

3. Follow the user manual for further guidance.
