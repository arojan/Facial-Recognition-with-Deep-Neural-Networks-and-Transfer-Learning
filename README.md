# Facial-Recognition-with-Deep-Neural-Networks-and-Transfer-Learning
This project attempts to recognise human faces with higher accuracy while having fewer data to train on with the use of transfer learning.

Go ahead and download the pretrained model 'rcmalli_vggface_tf_vgg16.h5' from the site: https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface/releases and store it in the 'models' directory of this repository. 

Add your custom dataset in the 'dataset' directory of this repository. Do some minor adjustments according to your need and its ready to go.
